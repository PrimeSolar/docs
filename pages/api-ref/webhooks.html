        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <p>Webhooks are user-defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP</a> callbacks. They are triggered by some event in a web application and can facilitate integrating different applications or third-party APIs, like Real&Mate.</p>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <p>When building Real&Mate integrations, you might want your applications to receive events as they occur in your Real&Mate accounts, so that your backend systems can execute actions accordingly.</p>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <p>The Real&Mate uses webhooks to let your application know when events happen, such as retrieving information about real estate objects or adding new ones. When the event occurs, Real&Mate makes an HTTP request (usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a POST or a GET</a>) to the URL you configured for the webhook. Real&Mate's request will include details of the event such as the user identifier or real estate parameters. Many other modern web services like GitHub and Slack also make use of webhooks to communicate events.</p>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <p>To enable webhook events, you need to register webhook endpoints. After you register them, the Real&Mate can push real-time event data to your applicationâ€™s webhook endpoint when events happen in your account. Real&Mate sends webhook events to your app as a JSON payload.</p>

        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <p>To start receiving webhook events in your app, create and register a webhook endpoint:</p>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <ol>
          <li>Create a webhook endpoint handler to receive event data POST requests.</li>
          <li>Test your webhook endpoint handler.</li>
          <li>Register your endpoint within Real&Mate.</li>
          <li>Secure your webhook endpoint.</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <p>For testing purposes during development, you may find it worthwhile to set up mock HTTP requests to your application. We suggest either using a command-line tool like <a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curl</a>, or a desktop application like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a>. </p>
