 * Mouse Movement Card Effect Script
 *
 * This script listens for the mouse movement over the "cards"
 * element and updates each card's CSS custom properties based on the mouse position
 * relative to the card. This allows for dynamic styling
 * effects triggered by the mouse position, enhancing the
 * interactivity and visual appeal of the card elements.
