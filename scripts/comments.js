/*
 * Commentary Display Script
 *
 * This script creates interactive commentary elements for each
 * <a-comment> tag found in the document. It inserts custom
 * <comment-tag> tags, enabling user interaction
 * to display or hide associated commentary. The
 * "displayCommentary" function toggles the visibility of the
 * commentary and adjusts layering. It also
 * checks if the preceding node is a <comment-label> to apply
 * a specific positioning rule.
