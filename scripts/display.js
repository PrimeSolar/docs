/*
 * Display Functionality Script
 *
 * This script prompts the user to enter their role
 * and dynamically adjusts the webpage content based on a role.
 *
 * It changes the subtitle and hides specific elements that are
 * not relevant to a user's role. Elements can be identified
 * by their respective classes.
 *
 * The script ensures that all unneeded sections and details
 * are hidden accordingly.
