  <td>API</td>
  <td><p>Application Programming Interface. It’s a collection of standardized protocols and tools that enable different technology systems to communicate and interact with one another. It serves as an interface that facilitates the access and delivery of data, allowing applications to request and exchange information seamlessly.</p></td>

  <td>Authorization</td>
  <td><p>Process of specifying access rights/privileges to resources. It identifies what kinds of data a user is allowed to access. To access data through the API, a data requestor supplies an authorization code &mdash; an API key or API token &mdash; and the user’s allowed level of data access is delivered through the API.</p></td>

In a RESTful system, resources are identified by URLs, and the state of the application is represented through the transfer of representations (such as JSON or XML) between a client and a server, allowing for a more efficient and flexible interaction model.</p></td>
